# Vore Mod for Minecraft

This is my Vore Mod for Minecraft. This mod adds items to the game that can be used for making vore creations. Such things are blocks like flesh and tongue and bodily fluids like stomach acid and blood. And a separate dimension for building the insides. 

This mod also adds the Shrink Gun. An item that players can use to make other players or mobs eat them.

Currently, I consider this mod a prototype. It is functional. There are more features that I want to add. But the core features have been added. They are as follows:

* Adds blocks and fluids for building stomachs.
* The shrink gun that can be used to make mobs eat the player.
* When a player is eaten, they are teleported to a seperate dimension where a stomach is created for that mob.
* Each mob can have their own stomach.
* The player can exit the stomach by leaving the same way that anything else exits the digestive system.
* The stomach acid is a hazard that can hurt the player.
* When any animal dies, there is a chance it will drop a piece of flesh. 
* 4 pieces of flesh can be crafted into a flesh block.

There are some things in the mob's NBT data that can tweak how/if they will eat players. I plan on making videos and guides related to that. In the meantime this is the mod prototype.
